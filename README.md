# Signed-Restricted-Sumset-Generator
Use to determine attributes of h-fold signed, restricted sumsets.

Let $A$ be of size $m$ and a subset of an abelian group $G$ of order $n$. We are interested in the minimum size of an $h$-fold signed restricted sumset of $A$ defined as
$\rho\hat{_{\pm}}(n, m, h)=\min\{|h\hat{_{\pm}}A|\mid A \subseteq G,|A|=m\}.$ Use sumset generator to produce values for $\rho\hat{_{\pm}}(n, m, h)$_ over desired variable ranges.
