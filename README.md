# Signed-Restricted-Sumset-Generator
Use to generate and examine h-fold signed, restricted sumsets.

Let $A$ be of size $m$ and a subset of an abelian group $G$ of order $n$. We are interested in the $h$-fold signed restricted sumset of $A$ defined as

$$h\hat{\_{\pm}}A=\lbrace \lambda\_{1}a_{1}+\cdots+\lambda\_{m}a\_{m} \\ \: \\ \lambda\_{1},\ldots,\lambda\_{m}\in\lbrace-1,0,1\rbrace,\\ |\lambda\_{1}|+\cdots+|\lambda\_{m}|=h \rbrace.$$

Using the sumset generator, we may easily characterize the smallest $h$-fold signed restricted sumset of $A$, defined as

$$\rho\hat{\_{\pm}}(n, m, h)=\min\lbrace |h\hat{\_{\pm}}A|\mid A \subseteq G,|A|=m\rbrace ,$$

for desired $n$, $m$, and $h$.
